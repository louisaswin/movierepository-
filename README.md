My Movie & TV Show Repository: A Personal Passion Project

Link to Shiny App: https://lswintosky.shinyapps.io/mediarepository/#146233

This is a repository of movies and tv shows I have watched and loved. 

Project Purpose:

1. Learn how to create and deploy a Shiny App and practice with using APIs to gather data
2. Provide a recommendation tool for movies/TV shows to friends/family, based on my own personal tastes and experiences
3. Catalogue movies and TV shows I have seen and loved for my own reference

When looking for a new movie or show to watch, I often find that the best recommendations come from friends. Some of my favorite shows have been recommendations from friends, and in turn, Iâ€™ve been thrilled to introduce my favorites to others. Over the years, I have curated various recommendation lists and really enjoyed the outcomes this has led to with friends. This led me to the idea of creating a more extensive, visually appealing list that can be sorted with ease.

This project was completed in various iterations, repetitively building up from simple versions to what it is now. It is finally in a version that is shareable, however, I hope to build on it when I have more free time. 

Ideas for future features / additions:
- Including critic ratings, movie ratings (pg, pg-13, etc.), movie runtime, notable cast names,  streaming service 
- Adding my own tags (ex: dystopian, book adaptation, slept on, oldies, movie series, etc.)
- Adding more movies/tv shows in general
- New tabs doing the same thing but with books and video games
- Filter that operates on exclusions
- Tab that has what items are on my watchlist/want to watch
- A more personalized recommendation feature that allows user to input a few movies and they get an output with similar movies 

Overall, my vision is to essentially build something that is akin to the recommendations you see when opening Netflix. However, my app has the credibility of me having seen it and being able to vouch for it.
